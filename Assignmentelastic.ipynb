    "Choosing the optimal values of the regularization parameters (lambda1 and lambda2) for Elastic Net Regression is crucial for achieving good predictive performance and balancing model complexity and sparsity. There are several methods for choosing the optimal values of the regularization parameters in Elastic Net Regression:\n",

    "Cross-validation: Cross-validation is a commonly used method for selecting the optimal values of lambda1 and lambda2. This involves dividing the data into training and validation sets, fitting the Elastic Net Regression model on the training set with different combinations of lambda1 and lambda2, and selecting the combination that produces the lowest prediction error on the validation set. This process is repeated for different partitions of the data, and the final values of lambda1 and lambda2 are chosen based on the average prediction error across all partitions.\n",

    "Information criteria: Information criteria such as the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) can also be used to select the optimal values of lambda1 and lambda2. These criteria balance the goodness of fit of the model with the complexity of the model and can provide a simple and efficient way to select the optimal values of lambda1 and lambda2.\n",

There are several methods for imputing missing values, including mean imputation, regression imputation, and multiple imputation.

This approach allows for the inclusion of all available data, but can increase the complexity of the model and may not be appropriate for large amounts of missing data.\n",
